Exercises from "Hands-On Introduction to LabView", by John Essick, 3rd edition, 2016. MathScript Node, available under Functions -> Programming -> sttructures, was added to do examples in chapter 4 on. To add this, the installation program had to be re-run and the option for this package chosen in the 'programs to be installed' window. This package provides a resizable box to enter text-based mathematical formulas directly on the block diagram. Formula Node, available in the basic version, provides some functionality; MathScript is preferred. 

I have multi-channel data that is already digitized. I want to read off the amplitudes of the signal from the foot to peak of a given pulse. Essick's book did not give information on adding cursors (at least not in the first few chapters). Labview had info online [here](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361P-01/lvhowto/adding_cursors_to_graphs/). You can set up two cursors for each of the pulses and read off the Y value differential. Note: can only do this if there is only one plot in a given graph channel (obviously).
